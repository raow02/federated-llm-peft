Long term users have seen Office evolve from its early days when it was installed on Windows machines to the relatively new Office 365 that is deployed online.  The key products in the Microsoft Office suite used by enterprises have been Word, Excel and Powerpoint. Google Docs is also an enterprise offering that consists of Docs, Sheets and Slides - these map to the corresponding Microsoft Office suite products listed.  Users who have been on Microsoft Office for many years find the move to Google Docs difficult.  This is because the commands across Google Docs are quite different to Office and one needs to spend time searching for MS office equivalent commands.  For example, the keyboard shortcut command to insert a freeze pane in windows excel is not the same in Google Sheets.  Formulae in cells and data analysis in Sheets is also different in sheets when compared to Excel. While it takes some time to unlearn commands and learn new ones as one moves from Microsoft Office to Google Docs, once one has spent some time working with Google Docs it starts to get easier.  And features such as ease of collaboration, never losing any content ever again, being able to work on the go from anywhere become the norm.

Sometimes referred to as GeoEngineering, these are projects on a truly planet-size scale. A project like this could, for example, consist of large reflective lightweight solar sails or other loft-able reflective material which could be seeded into the upper atmosphere to reflect some or all of the sunlight back into space. Another Idea would be to create massive and plentiful Co2 scrubbers to remove a noticeable quantity of the greenhouse gas, Co2, which works to reflect and prevent heat from the planet from leaving back out into space. Greatly reducing the quantity of Co2 in our atmosphere would allow more heat to escape the planet and consequently cool it down. Yet another thought might be to artificially and greatly increase the size of our ice caps which would lead to more sunlight being reflected back out into space.

To start, let's get the elephant out of the room, the big man down under has to be Joel Embiid for me. Offensively he is one of the best players in the league, no questions asked. Defensively, when he can stay out of foul trouble, he could easily make a run at DPOY (Defensive Player of the Year).  At the 4, im still going big because of this mans ability to move his feet. Jokic is a 280lb ballerina with Einstein'esque IQ and court vision like an owl. At the 3, I need a lock down defender and a court runner, oh, and two time MVP in Giannis Antetoukoumpo. I doubt this front court would be allowed to share an elevator. For my back court I need to support this tremendous front court cast with shooters and passers. Im going to pair Lamelo Ball with Luka Doncic to further bolster the teams height (avgs 6'9). Lamelo and Luka can both knock down the three ball, get to the paint off the dribble, execute the pick and roll flawlessly and are 6'6 and 6'7 respectively.

So don't be discouraged if you find someone doesn't like you as much as you think they should. \n\nHere are some tips for getting people to like you:\n\n- Ask them questions about themselves: People enjoy talking about themselves and if you ask them thoughtful questions they will see that you are a caring person who pays attention to them.\n- Read social cues: It's important to be able to understand when someone is not interested in what you are talking about. If you find someone you're talking to is looking around the room and giving you short responses, you should try and steer the conversation in a different direction to see if you can engage them.\n- Have a sense of humor: Laughing with other people is a great way to create bonds. You can try to be a little self-deprecating or just make innocent jokes about your situation. But be careful to not alienate people with humor if you don't know them well. Jokes about religion, politics, and other people might not go over well with some people.","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Can you sort these events from newest to oldest: James Cameron's movie Titanic was released, Leo Messi won world cup for Argentina, Barak Obama became president.","input":"","output":"Leo Messi won world cup for Argentina, Barak Obama became president, James Cameron's movie Titanic was released.","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"What can I do with a broken stapler?","input":"","output":"- Use the broken stapler as a paper weight\n- Use the broken stapler to hold staples for a new stapler\n- Use the broken stapler to hold a door ajar\n- Use the broken stapler to hold paper that needs to be filed\n- Use the broken stapler as a nutcracker","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Why might I want to stay at home on a Friday night?","input":"","output":"- You're feeling under the weather\n- The weather outside is stormy and dangerous\n- All your friends are busy and can't hang out with you\n- There's nothing fun going on\n- It's too crowded out there\n- You need to binge watch the latest show","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Give me a list of the top 10 types of clouds","input":"","output":"Cumulus, Stratus, Stratocumulus, Cirrus, Cirrocumulus, Cirrostratus, Cumulonimbus, Altocumulus, Nimbostratus, Altostratus,","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Give me a list of the best golf courses in America","input":"","output":"Pebble Beach, Torrey Pines, Pinehurst, TPC Scottsdale, Whistling Straights, Muirfield, Bethpage Black, Bay Hill","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Why can't the whole world be 2 countries?","input":"","output":"The whole world cannot be split into two countries because it would be impossible to maintain the balance of power between the two countries.","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Give me a list of the most famous tech companies in the world","input":"","output":"Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Oracle, Alibaba","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Give me a bulleted list of cricketers by highest number of international centuries scored","input":"","output":"Sachin Tendulkar - 100\nVirat Kohli - 75\nRicky Ponting - 71\nKumar Sangakkara - 63\nJacques Kallis - 62\nHashim Amla - 55\nMahela Jayawardene - 54\nBrian Lara - 53\nRahul Dravid - 48\nAB de Villiers - 47","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Give me a bulleted list of some programming languages","input":"","output":"* Java\n* C++\n* Python\n* C#\n* Rust\n\nThere are many programming languages.

There have been many “greatest of all time” jazz album lists developed by jazz publications and critics over the years. The following is a brief sampling of some of the top-rated albums from some of these lists.\n- Miles Davis: Kind of Blue (1959) Miles Davis’ masterpiece. One of the most influential albums of all time, because of its widespread influence on jazz, rock and classical genres. It is the greatest selling jazz album of all time, and usually the number one pick on critics’ albums rankings. It features a cool, atmospheric modal approach that is immediately recognizable, tuneful and approachable for just about any listener.\n- John Coltrane: A Love Supreme (1964). Widely regarded as John Coltrane’s masterpiece, it is an intense modal jazz through-composed spiritual meditation in four parts. Every critic interprets John Coltrane’s intent and meaning of A Love Supreme differently. Whether you think he’s searching for some form of soulful purity, or cutting out the middle man to speak directly to God, your jazz-listening life won’t be the same after hearing this searing testament.\n- Sonny Rollins: Saxophone Collosus (1957). Sonny Rollins’ breakthrough and best-known album. Rollins emerges here as a true jazz giant belonging in the same pantheon as Coltrane, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young. His strong and highly rhythmic thematic improvisational voice is on brilliant display in ‘St. Thomas’ and ‘Blue 7’. Not to be missed is his powerful rendition of the jazz standard ‘You Don’t Know Love’ and his lovely solo during Kurt Weil’s ‘Moritat’ (also known as ‘Mack the Knife’).\n- Dave Brubeck: Time Out (1959) Featuring uncommon time signatures and mix of Cool and West Coast jazz, Time Out was the first jazz album to sell over a million copies and produced a single, ‘Take Five’ that became the first jazz single to sell over a million copies. Brubeck described his saxophone player Paul Desmond’s sound as “like a dry martini”. You’ll want to ice up a glass and pour yourself another with each listen to this enduring jazz mainstay.\n- John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman: John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963) is a reluctant jazz ballad summit of giants. Johnny Hartman initially resisted the idea of recording an album with John Coltrane, believing they wouldn’t complement one another musically. Following an after-hours session with Coltrane and pianist McCoy Tyner, they agreed to work together and went in to the studio to record their self-title album that contained the definitive versions of ‘Lush Life’, ‘They Say It’s Wonderful’, and ‘My One and Only Love.’ This is an absolute essential album.\n- Billie Holiday: Lady in Satin (1958) Holiday’s album of Great American Songbook standards  - lushly arranged around her abused, fragile, but powerfully rhythmic voice - is a testament to her professional powers of persuasion and artistic willpower in what turned out to be the last year of a 44-yr life. She told her producers she wanted “a pretty album, something delicate.” They paid her $150 a side, in advance. Well, she gave them their money’s worth…and then some.

Find the puncture\nUsing the valve as your starting point, closely inspect the tread of the tyre to ﬁnd the cause of the puncture.\nPay close attention to the sidewalls (the non-treaded portion on the side of the tyre where the pressure and size information is printed\/moulded) to make sure there are no tears or holes.\nRemove any glass, grit or other debris that you spot. A small flat-head screwdriver or awl is the best tool for this, but be careful not to dig too deep. A small set of pliers can also be useful for removing embedded thorns.\nEven if you ﬁnd one possible cause of the puncture, continue checking the tyre thoroughly until you get back to the valve because there could well be more.\n\nStep 2. Remove the inner tube\nLet the air out of the inner tube and push the valve up into the tyre, unscrewing and retaining the valve lockring if ﬁtted.\nOn the side of the wheel opposite the valve, slip a tyre lever under the tyre’s bead and a further tyre lever about roughly 5cm away.\nPull the nearer tyre lever towards you, lifting the tyre’s bead over the edge of the rim. Continue until one bead of the tyre is completely free of the rim then pull the tube out.\nRemove the tyre completely from the rim – with most tyres this can be done by hand unless they are exceptionally tight.\n\nStep 3. Locate the puncture on the inner tube\nIf you are just going to replace the inner tube, move to step 6.\nIf you want to patch the inner tube – and you ought to, it’s not that hard! – inﬂate the tube and listen for air escaping.\nIf you’re struggling to find the hole by listening alone, try passing your lips over the top of the tube.\nIf the hole still can’t be found, re-inﬂate the tube and pass it through a bowl of water, or rub the tube down with soapy water, until you spot escaping bubbles. Be sure to dry the tube before proceeding to the next step.\n\nStep 4. Prepare the inner tube for patching\nSelect an appropriately sized patch – if in doubt, err on the side of caution and use a bigger rather than smaller patch.\nRoughen the surface of the tube around the hole with sandpaper (usually included with any good puncture repair kit).\nEnsure that any moulding marks on the tube are completely flattened down because these can cause issues when glueing. Thoroughly brush off any rubber ‘shavings’. Cleanliness is key when repairing a puncture.\nIf you’re using pre-glued patches – such as Park’s popular GP-2 patch kit – you can now patch the hole. Thoroughly press down on the patch to ensure it’s fully in contact with the tube.\nIf you’re using a ‘traditional’ glue-on patch kit, start by applying a generous drop of glue – or rubber cement by its proper name – to the tube and spread this across an area slightly larger than the patch you intend to use. Allow this to dry.\nSimilarly, apply a second, thinner layer. Once again, allow to dry – when the glue is dry, its surface will change from a shiny to a matte finish.\nThe key to ensuring a good long-lasting puncture repair is patience, so don’t rush this step.\n\nStep 5. Patching an inner tube\nFirmly press the patch into place after removing the backing foil – cleanliness is also key to a good repair, so leave removing the foil until the very last moment.\nIf there’s a thin cellophane backing on the patch, it can be left on. It’s good practice to dust any stray glue with chalk, talcum powder or fine road dust to prevent it from sticking to the inside of the tyre casing.\n\nStep 6. Inspect the tyre casing and rim tape\nBefore refitting the tube, thoroughly double\/triple-check the inside of the tyre casing – there’s nothing more frustrating than going to the effort of patching a tube only to puncture it again with a stray thorn you may have missed.\nIt’s also good practice to check the rim tape. If a hard plastic rim strip – often found on cheaper bikes – is torn, it leaves a sharp edge that can easily slice a tube.\nLikewise, if your rim tape has slipped, it can leave eyelets or spoke holes exposed, which can also puncture a tube.\nIf you have persistent problems with your rim tape puncturing your tube, try swapping it out for new tape tape \n\n\nStep 7. Refit the tyre\nAfter repairing the tube and thoroughly checking the tyre, reﬁt one side of the tyre – one bead, to use the correct term – to the rim.\nSlightly inﬂate the tube (just enough to give it structure) and reﬁt it to the wheel, putting the valve through its hole first.\nStarting at the opposite side of the rim to the valve, use your thumbs to lift the tyre’s bead over the rim. Work your way around the rim until there’s just one small section of the tyre left.\nPush the valve up into the tyre and then, using your thumbs, ease the remaining section of the tyre’s bead over the edge of the rim.\nIf the tyre is particularly tight, avoid the temptation to use a tyre lever to push the last section of the tyre onto the rim – you’ll almost certainly pinch your inner tube doing so.\nIf you’re struggling to pop the tyre onto the wheel, try putting the tyre on the ground, holding it in place with your feet and rolling the bead back toward you – heavy gloves really help here. This takes a little practice but should work with even the most stubborn tyres.\n\n\nStep 8. Check the repair and inflate the tyre\nCheck that the tube isn’t trapped between the rim and the tyre bead by working your way around the tyre, pushing the bead into the well of the rim.\nIf the tube is trapped, try ‘massaging’ the tyre to encourage it to seat properly. Pumping it up a small amount may also help to seat the tube properly.\nInﬂate the tyre to a point where it feels soft but has maintained its shape. Then check that the moulding mark around the tyre follows the rim evenly all the way around.\nIf not, deﬂate a little and ease any high spots down and pull low spots up until the bead is ﬁtted evenly.\nInﬂate fully and check once again that the tyre’s bead is still seated evenly and that the tyre isn’t lifting off the rim at any point, then adjust your pressures to suit.","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Why do you love Biriyani?","input":"","output":"Because it's flavorful","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Give me a list of the seven best beach honeymoon locations for 2024.","input":"","output":"The Maldives\nSantorini\nMaui\nBora Bora\nBali\nJamaica\nSeychelles","category":"brainstorming"},{"instruction":"Who are the best starting MLB pitchers of all time?","input":"","output":"There are many ways to argue who the best pitchers of all time are.
