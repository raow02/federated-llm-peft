While most observations about the universe leave the question unanswered the broad strokes are as follows.\n\nTheologians state in many religions that there is an organizing force known as God providing direction to the universe.  Humans that best align with this organizing force or God are guaranteed good fortune in this life or after.  There are variations in humans level of involvement in this process with Christianity requiring a savior (Jesus) for people to enter the afterlife vs achieving a higher state of consciousness in this life or through reincarnation.\n\nPhilosophers differ on the meaning of life with predominate views following down the lines of seeking your own fulfillment or the fulfillment of others.  Seeking your own fulfillment has been a major component of capitalism, self-preservation, and risk taking that lead to new discoveries in Science and Technology.  Seeking the fulfillment of others has lead to great advancements in philanthropy, equality, and the general well being of society.  This \"social compact\" insures stability and provides an expectation that harmful activities like Murder, Robbery, etc are discouraged and punished.\n\nScientists view this question through the lens of the observable universe.  As such efforts have been made to create a \"unifying theory of everything\" to show some understandable order to the universe.  Others have focused their study on the improbability of how humans could have been created in a universe with seemingly random and infinite chance.  Some scientists have conceded that the question is something Science is ill-fitted to answer.\n\nMost importantly Douglas Adams, a prominent British author specializing in absurdity, answered the question in the book \"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\" with the answer \"42.\"","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What is the sport called Cricket","input":"","output":"Cricket is a sport first originated in Wngland. Cricket was invented by British. While cricket was primarily played starting 17th century, there have been some obscure and speculative references of sport being played in 13th century during era of King Edward II. Cricket is game played with a flat bat and a ball with each team consisting of 11 players. The goal of the game is to score as many runs as a team can score while getting their turn to bat and getting the other team out before they can reach their target. Each team can bat once and have to field while other team bats. Cricket is played in circular or oval shaped fields. The patch in the middle of the ground is called the pitch which is 22 yards in length. At each end of the pitch, three sticks are planted in the ground called stumps. Two small wooden pieces are placed on top of stumps called bails. This setup is called a wicket. Two batters from the batting team will bat on each end of the pitch. Runs are scored by hitting a ball and then running back and forth from one end of the pitch to another end. Batter can send the ball to the boundary while pitching on the ground one or more times to score 4 runs or hit the ball over the boundary without having it bounce on the ground to score 6 runs. Fielding team will place 11 of their players at various locations in the field. Person from the fielding team throwing the ball to a batter from batting team is called a bowler. Bowler’s goal is to get the batter out. Bowler will typically throw the ball on the pitch letting it bounce once on the pitch and eventually reaching a batter. There are different ways to dismiss or get a batter out. The bowler can throw the ball to a batter, induce a shot from the batter and have that ball caught directly by one of the fielder in the field. Bowler can also throw the ball toward a batter to make him or her miss and to hit the stumps or bails, thus disturbing his wicket. Bowler will deliver ball 6 times when their turn comes up. The grouping of 6 deliveries that a bowler throws to a batter is called an Over. Batters can also get run out while attempting to score a run and getting caught outside of their safe zone marked by a crease at each end of the pitch. Modern game of cricket contains many versions. These versions are called Test Cricket, One day internationals (ODI), and Twenty20. Originally, game of cricket lasted for many days. In the older version of the game , each team got a chance to bat twice and field twice taking as many days as possible to conclude the game. In modern version of the game, this mode of play called Test Cricket has been fixed to five days. So, Test cricket can last as many as five days.  One day internationals (also referred to as ODI) is a game of cricket that lasts one day. Each side gets 50 overs to bowl to another team and each side gets to bat once. Goal of a team is to score as many runs as possible in 50 overs while restricting their opposition to lesser score or getting them out completely. ODI typically lasts for 6 to 7 hours. Even more popular version of the game is called Twenty20 or T20. In this mode of the game, each team only gets 20 overs to bat and have to get their opponents out in 20 overs or to restrict them to lesser number of runs. This mode of cricket is very popular because the game only lasts for 3 hours requiring much less time of the viewers. There are many countries beside England that currently play cricket making the sport a truly global sport. The countries that play cricket are England, South Africa, Australia, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies.  The sport is also played by new entrants in the game, namely Netherlands, Ireland, Namibia, UAE, Afghanistan, USA, Canada, Papua New Guinea.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Will the Penrith Panthers win the NRL Grand Final this year?","input":"","output":"While it is very hard to predict the outcome of a future sporting event, all evidence shows that the Penrith Panthers have been very successful in the recent past, winning both the 2021 and 2022 NRL Grand Finals and losing the 2020 NRL Grand Final.

Therefore, one should abandon the search for meaning and embrace the absurdity of life. According to Camus, the lack of meaning in our existence is not negative, simply neutral.

As the airplane moves forward, more and more air moves over the wing.  The airplane wings are designed to be curved over the top and flat across the bottom.  As a result, the air molecules take longer to travel over the top of the wing than they do on the underside.  This creates a differential in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing.  The difference in air pressure is called Lift.  As thrust increases and pulls the plane forward, the lift eventually increases enough to overcome the weight and drag and the airplane will take flight.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"How do you clear a scuba mask underwater ?","input":"","output":"If your scuba mask fills with water while you are submerged, you can clear the water by following this simple process.\n\n1) Inhale through your mouth\n2) Push the top front edge of the mask towards your face, or lightly lift the lower section from your face\n3) Exhale through your nose.\n\nBy reducing the pressure on the lower portion of the mask, and exhaling through your nose, the air added to the mask will force the water out of the bottom seal.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What is an enzyme inhibitor?","input":"","output":"An enzyme inhibitor is a molecule that binds to an enzyme's active site, or another site on the enzyme, and blocks the enzyme's catalysis of the reaction. Enzyme inhibitors are generally specific to one enzyme and control that enzyme's activity. They also control essential enzymes such as proteases or nucleases that, if left unchecked, may damage a cell. \n\nMany poisons produced by animals or plants are enzyme inhibitors, and many drug molecules are enzyme inhibitors that inhibit an aberrant human enzyme or an enzyme critical for the survival of a pathogen. Since anti-pathogen inhibitors generally target only one enzyme, such drugs are highly specific and generally produce few side effects in humans. \n\nMedicinal enzyme inhibitors often have low dissociation constants, meaning a minute amount of the inhibitor will inhibit the enzyme.

Do they have ejector seats like in jets?","input":"","output":"No, helicopters do not have ejector seats because they would eject the pilot into the helicopter's rotor system.  During an emergency or other loss of power, helicopter pilots auto-rotate.  Auto-rotation is the decoupling of the rotor system from the engines to allow upward air flow to drive the rotor system at a faster than normal rate, providing kinetic energy that can be traded to arrest the helicopter's rate of descent.  To initiate auto-rotation, the helicopter pilot flattens the pitch in the rotor system's blades, reducing drag, and allowing the upward flow of air to drive its rotation.  When the helicopter is 100-150 feet above the ground, the pilot will then aggressively increase the pitch of the rotor system's blades, temporarily increasing lift and cushioning the helicopter's landing.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What kind of Toys should be prepare for a new puppy","input":"","output":"• Puppy’s teeth can be strong, and they can easily destroy soft\ntoys.

But assuming one has found the right person, there are comparative advantages and disadvantages to marrying at a young age or an older age. Men have the advantage of not needing to worry about the 'biological clock' - unlike women, their reproductive age can extend into quite a late age, whereas women typically lose the ability to reproduce once they hit around the age of 40. An advantage of having children when one is young is that a man will have more energy and physical dexterity to be able to engage in physical activities with his children, like camping, biking, hiking, sports, skiing, etc. Bending over to change diapers will not be as painful on the back and knees. As a younger man, travel with children may be less discomforting. As an older man, one might have more time or flexibility of time to spend with one's children. An older man may also have greater financial resources to help make child raising easier. For example, an older man might have a larger house, or a greater ability to afford in-house child care. On the other hand, there are studies that show having an older father may increase the odds of a child having autism or attention deficit disorder. Anecdotally, it seems people who marry at a young age are more likely to divorce. But perhaps having two marriages, one when one is young and another when one is older, is not a bad thing. Men have the advantage of being able to sire two sets of children at different times in their lives, making this possible. But ultimately the decision should be based on whether or not you have met the person you know without a doubt you want to spend the rest of your life with. If you have found that person, you should stay with them.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What activities does a 4 year old like?","input":"","output":"With the caveat that each kid is different, at 4 years old kids like fun & stimulation.

These tools can incorporate text, audio file, video files, and links to files. They're usually used for one to one, one to many (small group), or one to many (large group). \n\nEmail can be used both for short and informal and longer, more formal communications. In fact, emails have fully supplanted the \"interoffice memo\" used for decades in the corporate world.\n\nPresentations are a widely used tool in enterprises today. These typically include both a live presenter and prepared slides for the audience to see, and usually, take away. Tools for creating these slide show, also referred to as \"decks,\" include Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides.

The allure of traveling to new and exciting places, the potential for airline and hotel program status benefits, meeting new people, etc.  All of these things may be exactly what you are looking for.  But my advice for anyone who is considering a position with significant travel and who has not experienced that type of work-life before is to think about all the things in their life that they are involved with that make them happy.  Think hard about whether you can take them on the road with you, reproduce them wherever your business travel takes you, or do without them.  Perhaps you have a standing poker night each month with your friends.  You may not be able to attend that with any regularity.  You may love the climbing gym or cycling club at home.  Can you replace that with hotel gyms?  Do you stick to a diet that will be hard to keep when you need to eat out a lot?  Do you have a relationship at home that will suffer if you are gone a lot?  The list can go on and on and is different for each person.  But it is critical to evaluate this aspect of how your life will change when you travel a lot of the time and make sure you are happy with the accommodations and changes you will need to make.  Another important consideration is whether you will be traveling to different time zones.  Often the idea of globetrotting to different parts of the world is very exciting, but you will have to deal with jetlag while maintaining your work performance.  You will end up dealing with canceled or delayed flights, traffic, and other types of travel disruptions.  Ultimately, a job with significant travel can involve a lot of excitement and fun.  But it is not right for everyone. It is not vacation travel.

What will typically happen is at the time of impact, the face is open in relation to the target (ie aimed to the right if you are a right handed golfer) and the swing path is closed in relation to the target (ie aimed to the left if you are a left handed golfer).  When there is a large difference between the path of the swing and the face of the club, the impact will generate a high degree of lateral spin on the ball causing the flight of the ball to curve away from the target.  Here are some ways to fix this swing fault:\n\n1. Grip the club with a stronger grip.  This means the v formed between your thumb and pointer finger on back hand is pointed to your rear shoulder and your opposite hand it also gripping the club more from the back.  This will help you close the face of the club at impact.\n2. Focus on keeping the face closed in the backswing.  One fault many amateurs have is the club face opens toward the sky on the backswing too far meaning that the face will need to turn more on the downswing to get to square at impact.  Creating less rotation on the backswing can help with this.  \n3. Keeping hips down and back in the downswing.  One fault that can cause inconsistent contact as well as a slice is when the hips thrust forward during the downswing causing the golfer to lift up to counter being too close to the ball which can often cause an over the top, out-to-in swing path.  Try to keep the hips back through the swing and focus on rotating the body to keep forward or lateral movement to a minimum.  \n\nA slice is a very common issue among golfers but knowing the causes and swing faults that lead to a slice can help you think about how you can improve your swing to fix it.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"When to use mulch for your landscape?","input":"","output":"Mulch can prevent weeds from growing.

For example, to compute the square root of 8, we might start with 3, since we know 9 is the square of 3. Given a guess, the method is a formula for generating the next guess. The formula states the next guess should be average of the current guess and the square (the number for which you want compute the square root) divided by the guess. Returning to our example, the next guess is (3 + 8\/3)\/2 = 17\/6. Applying this formula repeatedly yields a guess which is closer and closer to actual square root.\n\nThe reason this works is that limit of the sequence of guesses generated by this formula is the square root. To see this, first recognize that in the limit, next guess must be equal to the current guess. The guesses get closer and closer until, after an infinite number of steps, they are the same. Using a variable X to represent the limit and applying the formula yields an equation which can be solved for X via algebra. The solution is that X must be square root.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Define judicial review and explain John Marshall’s role in establishing judicial review.","input":"","output":"Judicial review is a power the courts have to declare that a federal or state law violates the Constitution thereby nullifying the law making it enforceable. Just before President Adams left office he appointed new justices of the peace for Washington D.C., Jefferson, the next President refused to deliver the commissions.  This led to the case Marbury vs Madison.  The basis of the case was that the Judiciary Act of 1789 allowed for the appointed to request a court order to grant their appointments with original jurisdiction given to the Supreme Court. John Marshall saw that siding with Jefferson would make it seem like the Supreme Court was his lackey.  If they sided with Adams, there was no way to make Jefferson enforce the ruling.  Both decisions would reduce the Supreme Court's legitimacy. John Marshall side-stepped this problem by striking down the Judiciary Act on the grounds that it was unconstitutional.

If you were advising a group seeking to guarantee certain civil rights today (for example, disabled people, gays\/lesbians, or immigrants) which would you advise them to use?","input":"","output":"There were four strategies employed by the leaders of the modern civil rights movement.  The first was legalism, which used the courts to attack discriminatory laws or practices.  The limits of legalism are the cost, slow change, burden on the individual and it was elite driven.  The second was nonviolent direct action (NVDA).  NVDA identifies an unjust law which is then broken by individuals trying to promote change.  Individuals must then accept the consequences of breaking the law, but if enough do so, it puts pressure on local governments.  The third strategy was political action, which used voting on proactive agendas to force change.  Finally, the fourth strategy was the black power movement.  This strategy promoted disengagement from white-society and setting up a separate black power structure.  It provided services to the black community and promoted positive black images, but had weak leadership and was prone to violence and paranoia.\nIf I was advising a civil rights group today, I would advise them to use the first three strategies.  Legalism, NVDA and political action are positive and effective ways to enable change.  They usually encourage sympathetic news coverage and get the message of the group out to the broader public.  A strategy like the black power movement would not be effective.  If you want to change society, you can’t separate from it or try to change it from the outside.  You need to work within the system to change it. Violence will also turn public support away from your group and allow government agencies to crack down on your leadership, making it hard to continue to bring about the change you desire.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Which is the best place to have Masala Dosa in Bangalore","input":"","output":"The top 5 best places to have Masala Dosa in Bangalore are\n1.

Many Louisiana natives and surrounding southern states eat these crustaceans.  To eat crawfish, sometimes called crawdads or mudbugs, you first need to purchase them.  Crawfish are usually sold by the sack with typical weights around 30-40 pounds.  You must then clean the crawfish as their natural habitats are within mud, swamps, and muck.   Rinsing them thoroughly in water is required.  Many will do this a sack at a time and continue to rinse until the water is crystal clear noting that they're clean.  Others go a step further through a process of purging.  This is using salt to have the crawfish clean out its insides.  Many think purging is a myth and simply skip this step.  Once clean, you'll want to bring a large pot (typically 80+ quarts in size) of water to a rolling boil.  Add in spices to flavor the water.  There are also pre-made bags of spice known as 'boil.'  Boil the crawfish until they float to the top and turn bright red.  Then allow the crawfish to soak to absorb the added spice.  This process can last as long as an hour or more, though 30 minutes is fairly typical.  Many people will add potatoes, corn, onions, and other sides to their boil.  Learning to peel a crawfish is an art, but can be quickly done by twisting off the tail.  Peel the rest of the shell off and eat the tail.  Many will also suck the head to get a burst of flavor.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What's loquat fruit and where does it originate from?","input":"","output":"The loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) is a large evergreen shrub or tree, grown commercially for its orange fruit and for its leaves, which are used to make herbal tea. It is also cultivated as an ornamental plant.\n\nThe loquat is in the family Rosaceae, and is native to the cooler hill regions of south-central China.[2][3] In Japan the loquat is known as biwa (枇杷, びわ), and has been grown for over 1,000 years. The loquat has been introduced to regions with subtropical to mild temperate climates throughout the world.[4][5]\n\nEriobotrya japonica was formerly thought to be closely related to the genus Mespilus, and is still sometimes mistakenly known as the Japanese medlar.

It is mostly regarded as an \"upper-class\" sport reserved for members of private country clubs, but has gained a lot of popularity over the last few decades. As a result, golf has become more broadly accessible to the general public, and today the sport is enjoyed by tens of millions of people around the world. \n\nIn golf, there are a total of eighteen stretches of grass, known as holes. Each hole is comprised of a tee box, where the golfer hits his or her initial shot, the fairway, and the green. Most holes also include deep grass that runs along the fairways, known as \"the rough\". For added difficulty, holes can also contain hazards like sand bunkers or bodies of water like ponds and creeks. A small circular hole is located on every green and is marked with a flag so that golfers can see it from far away. The objective is to get your golf ball from the tee box into that small hole in as few shots (known as \"strokes\") as possible. Golfers advance their ball by striking it with a golf club, and each ball strike is counted as a stroke. Golfers are allowed to use up to 14 golf clubs over the course of their round, each of which is used for different purposes, from different distances. Some clubs, like the driver, are used to hit the ball very long distances. In fact, most professional golfers are able to drive the ball over 300 yards. That's the length of three football fields! A combination of clubs called irons make up the majority of a set of golf clubs. They are are generally used to advance the ball to the green after the golfer hits his or her initial tee shot. The club face of each iron is designed with a different loft angle. Higher loft angles enable golfers to hit the ball higher in the air and shorter distances, whereas low loft angles produce lower trajectory shots that travel longer distances. The most frequently used club in the set is the putter, which is used to tap the ball from wherever it lies on the green into the hole. On average, most good golfers will putt the ball twice per hole, or approximately 36 times per round. \n\nGolf holes are designated as par 3, par 4, or par 5, depending on their length. These numbers are an indication of how many strokes it should take for a professional golfer to complete the hole. Par 3 holes are shorter, and should take a single stroke to get the ball from tee to green. Par 5 holes are longer, and should typically take three strokes to get from tee to green. Most golf courses have four par 3 holes, four par 5 holes, and ten par 4 holes, yielding an aggregate of par 72. At the end of a round of golf, players calculate their final score by aggregating their total number of strokes across all eighteen holes. Over time, the golfer's skill level is assessed by his or her \"handicap\", which is a system that reflects the average number of strokes over par that the player typically shoots. For example, if one's average round score is 79, their handicap is 7 because it's 7 strokes above par. The lower the handicap, the better the golfer.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Who is the greatest NBA player of all time?","input":"","output":"The debate regarding who is the greatest NBA player of all time generally revolves around defining what criteria should be used to rank basketball players. Factors such as number of championships won, individual accolades, career statistics, longevity, and the level to which a player's level of play dominated over their contemporaries are common criteria for determining who is the greatest NBA player of all time. However, this question is complicated by others who state that comparing players across different generations is not possible, and thus the debate should be focused on who is the greatest player within a given generation.\n\nThe NBA.com website states that \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time\". Jordan's perfect record in the finals, dominance over contemporaries (many of whom did not win any championships during the years Jordan was active), and holding the highest career regular season scoring average are often used to justify his status as the greatest NBA player of all time.

But in both cases, the application allows you to organize emails by using filters or rules to automatically store them in a particular folder or apply a specific label for easy retrieval at a later time. The key distinction, however, is that an email can belong to only one folder at a time i.e., a 1-1 relationship, whereas a variety of labels can be applied on a single email i.e., a 1-many relationship. I love using email filter rules just as much as anyone that's interested in taming their email Inbox.

There are institutional as well as psychological factors that affect turnout. Institutional factors include voter registration requirements, timing and frequency of elections, location of polling places, and complexity of ballots. Psychological factors include political efficacy, interest and engagement of the electorate, and political party membership. Voter turnout in the United States can be increased, and I will propose two simple reforms that would increase voter turnout. I will also propose another more complex reform that would dramatically increase voter turnout but would be difficult to implement by the state governments.\nSeveral institutional factors determine voter turnout. As each state has the power to hold elections, these factors vary across the states. The difficulty or ease of voter registration will have an impact on turnout. Minnesota has a very high turnout allowing same-day voter registration, while Texas has a low turnout and has a 30-day requirement. The day and time an election is also held matters. For example, the U.S. holds federal elections on a Tuesday in November during work hours which reduces voter turnout. The frequency of elections will have an influence on turnout. There are many elections per year in the U.S., and voters get fatigued and stop going to the polls. Voters are also less likely to vote if they don't have convenient polling places that are nearby and easy to access. Schools are the best and most accessible polling locations, but the U.S. holds elections on Tuesdays, which limits the availability of school space and parking. Lastly, complex ballots diminish enthusiasm and negatively impact U.S. voter turnout.\nAlong with institutional factors, there are psychological factors that control voter turnout. One of which is political efficacy which is defined in two ways. The first is internal efficacy which is how well you think you are able to understand politics. The second is external efficacy which is how well you feel the system responds to your input. Essentially, if you think you are smart enough and your vote \"matters,\" you have high efficacy and tend to go to the polls. The next psychological factor is interest, which is a measure of how much you care about politics. If you don't care, it's highly unlikely that you will vote. The last psychological factor is partisanship. Are you a member of a political party? If yes, then it's more likely you'll go vote to support your party. \nBy voting age population, turnout in the U.S. is around 53%. This shows the United States has a low turnout compared to other democracies and puts the U.S. 7th from the bottom when compared to 35 other democracies. Australia has the highest turnout, with just over 90%. The reason for Australia's high turnout is that voting is compulsory, with fines for people who don't vote. \"Voting in Australia is like a party,\" with election day described as a country-wide BBQ with easy-to-access polling locations held on a Saturday. In Australia, \"Forcing people to engage in the process increases their knowledge of the issues and candidates,\" thereby increasing Australia's political interest and engagement. By contrast, polls in the U.S. consistently show us that Americans don't know much about politics and are neither engaged nor interested in politics. Converse argues that people in the U.S. have low levels of ideological constraint and conceptualization. This shows that Americans have low political efficacy.\n\tIn general American turnout is low, but Voter Eligible Population (VEP) turnout varies dramatically across the states. Hawaii has the least VEP turnout, with approximately 43%. To compare, the state with the highest VEP turnout is Minnesota, with 75%. Texas comes in 3rd from the bottom with 53%. Minnesota's high turnout is explained by \"easy access to the ballot,\" \"a sense of civic responsibility,\" \"high rates of educational attainment and income,\" and \"competitive and interesting elections.\" By comparison, the main reasons Hawaii turnout is so low are that it's \"hard to register,\" voter disinterest and low efficacy, and it's a \"one-party state\". This combination of institutional and psychological factors, beneficial in Minnesota, and detrimental in Hawaii, has a significant impact on a state's turnout. \n\tI propose two simple solutions to increase voter turnout. The first would be to move elections to the weekend or require that companies give employees the day off to vote. Sunday is the most common election day in the world outside the United States. I believe this would be a beneficial institutional factor that would increase voter turnout because the majority of other countries have higher voter turnout than the United States. Unfortunately, the chances of this happening are slim as Congress has proposed bills to move elections to the weekend or have a Federal holiday for voting, but these bills have never moved out of committees.\n\tThe second simple solution would address the institutional factor of registration requirements by implementing same-day voter registration in all 50 states. Minnesota allows for same-day registration, and its turnout is around 20% higher than Texas, which does not allow it. States that have implemented same-day voter registration have seen an average of a 5% increase in voters (\"Same Day Voter\"). To prevent voter fraud, systems should be put in place to make sure the voter hasn't already voted and to check for valid identification showing the voter is a resident of the state or county. Another deterrent to committing voter fraud would be criminal penalties, including jail time and fines. Enacting legislation in each state to implement a system to handle would take time, but I think it's possible as currently, 21 states allow same-day voting registration (\"Same Day Voter\"). \n\tThe third solution I propose would address most of the institutional factors. This would be an online\/app-based voting option. The vast majority of Americans these days have mobile phones with internet connections. Those that don't would still have all of the current voting options, such as polling locations and mail-in voting. Security and verification would combine blockchain (similar to Bitcoin identities), biometrics, and facial recognition artificial intelligence. When registering to vote, a state agency would create your blockchain voter identification, fingerprint, and take a LiDAR(Light Detection and Ranging) 3D map of your face. These three technologies would ensure one vote per person. Also, this technology is all readily available and, while complex to implement, would provide several advantages over our current voting system. It would eliminate the need for convenient polling locations, as you can vote anywhere. The timing of elections would be fine, as you could vote during a work break. The frequency of elections would also be less of an issue because you wouldn't have to go to a polling location. The complexity of the ballot could be addressed in the application, which would allow links showing descriptions of candidates and issues.\n\tWhile voter turnout in the United States is low compared to other democratic countries, there are both simple and complex solutions that can increase voter participation. States with high voter turnout should be models for other states to follow as they have implemented practical reforms like same-day voter registration. The United States can then look to other countries and enact common sense solutions like voting on the weekend or on election holidays. Finally, we can use technology safely and responsibly to take voting into the 21st century and remove all the barriers to voting that our existing system places between the voter and the ballot.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What is the best musical instrument to learn?","input":"","output":"Piano.

But historians have generally narrowed it down to the following major causes:\n\nRise of ethnic nationalism in Soviet Republics:  After decades of suppressing national identities, ethnic groups began asserting their nationality and demanded greater autonomy and political power.  This resulted in numerous riots and protests throughout the Soviet Union with demands for independence and national self-determination. \n\nEconomic stagnation and fall of oil prices:  The centrally planned economic model resulted in massive shortages of staple consumer products.  Shops were continually empty and Soviet citizens needed to wait in long lines to purchase basic goods.  After years of economic deprivation, Soviet citizens were deeply angry at their government. In addition, oil prices declined significantly in the late 1980s, which provided the Soviet government a key source of hard currency.  This it made it difficult for the Soviet government to sustain high levels of military spending and keep the economy functioning. \n\nPerestroika and Glasnost: Gorbachev's reforms of the 1980s were intended to reinvigorate the Soviet economy.  However, they unintentionally triggered an opening of debate throughout the country.  The increased freedoms allowed people to more openly criticize the government and demand changes.  \n\nAfghanistan and Chernobyl: In the late 1980s, two events symbolized the incompetence of the Soviet government.  The failure of the Afghanistan war resulted in a loss of confidence in the Soviet military. The Chernobyl disaster revealed the incompetence and duplicity of the Soviet regime, resulting in a further erosion of trust.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What is engineering culture?","input":"","output":"Engineering culture often refers to common beliefs and behaviors of engineers within a company.

Some of the most important are extreme confidence, sound batting mechanics, and coordination developed though a combination of talent and practice.  \n\nAll great hitters share some consistencies in their batting mechanics such as their lower half mechanics, their hand and bat path, and their head and eye movement.\n\nWith their lower half mechanics they generate powerful torque from the ground up by timing the planting their feet in a balanced position and forcefully rotating and opening their hips.  Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion. \n\nThere are many nuances of batting mechanics that all great hitters share but these are some of the most important.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Will immunity increase when you have pets like Dogs\/Cats?","input":"","output":"Mostly yes! immunity increases of humans with pets excluding the people with pet dander allergy.

The King is just one of sixteen pieces that each player can use during the game. The other fifteen pieces include: Eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and a queen. The pieces are placed on an eight by eight, square board in a fixed starting position. The game begins by the player using the white pieces moving one of their pieces to another square. Each player will then alternate playing one move turns. Each piece has a set of legal moves that it can perform. For example, a bishop can only move diagonally on squares of its same color, whereas rooks can only move vertically or horizontally. The goal of the game is to use your pieces in a strategic manner that ultimately leads to your opponent's King being captured. The most common way to achieve this is by using your pieces to capture your opponent's pieces that are defending the King, and then exploiting this weakness to attack the King. While it's important to play on the offensive, it's equally as important to understand your opponent's strategy, so that you can properly defend against their attempts to capture your own King.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Who is the best shooter in the NBA?","input":"","output":"Jose Harris has the highest 3-pointers percentage, but Stephen Curry is THE best shooter in the NBA all time.

Pitchers are only allowed two forms of disengagement which will reduce the number of pickoff attempts and mound step offs. In the event of a third disengagement, the pitcher will be charged with a balk leading to a base advancement for any runner on base or a ball given to the batter.\n\n3. Eliminating the shift.

Get enough sleep - studies show that muscles recover better if you get at least 8 hours of sleep each night.\n3. Fuel your body - you can't gain muscle if you don't provide your body with enough calories to keep yourself fueled. Ensure that you are eating a good mix of protein, carbohydrates, and vegetables to set yourself up for success.\n4. Don't overtrain - One common mistake new runners make is to run more than they are trained to manage and end up injuring yourself. You can't build fitness if you are off of training due to injury!","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"How do you cook eggs?","input":"","output":"There are many ways to cook eggs but my favorite is over-easy.  Ideally you will use a non-stick sauce pan around 8-9\" in diameter.  Heat the sauce pan on the stove on medium heat.  You will know its ready when drops of water sizzle on the pan's surface.  You can use non-stick spray or butter to coat the pan first.  Carefully crack an egg in half and pour the insides slowly onto the heated pan.  Wait 1-2 minutes until you see the clear part of the egg turn mostly white and the edges look firm.  Use a turner to slide under the side of the egg and flip the egg over gently.  The other side of the egg cooks quickly.  After a minute carefully use the turner to scoop up the egg onto the plate.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What is your favorite fast-casual restaurant and why?","input":"","output":"Chipotle is my favorite place to grab a quick bite to eat.

The millions of galleries and museums dedicated to preserving and enriching artistic culture are proof of this.\n\nMany would argue that, through art, thoughts and emotions can be inspired, allowing people to connect on a deeper level to the beauty of the human experience. \n\nThe use of art can also be analysed from a financial perspective. It not only allows for the artist to express their imagination and sell their paintings, but it also generates employment in the creative industry.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the lack of practicability of art, its intrinsic value is visible through the appreciation of beauty and talent.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Why is the sky blue?","input":"","output":"Blue light is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of air in Earth's atmosphere.

The relative amount of change, expansion, or shrinkage differs for each of the three main grain directions.  Those directions are longitudinal, radial, and tangential.  Longitudinal is the direction a tree or its branches grows length-wise.  In most lumber, this is its length.  The change in this direction is very small.  That is why a wooden ruler can be used without changing its measurements when ambient moisture changes.  In almost all uses, longitudinal expansion and contraction are small enough not to be of concern.  Radial and tangential directional expansion and contraction are significant and different enough that they affect the dimensional stability of a piece of wood.  The relative amount of change in each direction is specific to the wood species.  Regardless of wood species, the change is greater in the tangential direction than in the radial direction.  The tangential direction is tangential to the growth rings in the wood, and the radial direction is perpendicular to the growth rings.  The T\/R or ratio of tangential to radial change correlates to the dimensional stability of a wood species.  If you visualize a piece of lumber that is milled square and comes from a part of a log such that the rings are almost straight across in one direction, that is referred to as vertical grain or quarter sawn.  As the moisture content of the wood changes to come into equilibrium with its environment, it will move toward a diamond shape.  The closer the T\/R ratio is to 1, the less the square dimension will distort. Dimensional stability and the direction of wood movement is important to plan for when cutting joinery in wood.  If two joined pieces are aligned so that they will not move in the same direction relative to the joint, the joint will be unstable when the ambient humidity changes and can cause the joint to fail.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Give me a list of important things to take on an international trip","input":"","output":"Here's a list of most important things you need on an international trip :\n\n1.

This bias conditions human beings to use any new evidence to confirm their pre-existing beliefs, and to reject any new evidence that contradicts these beliefs. People may also experience the so-called illusory superiority, another bias that conditions them to overestimate their skills and make them believe they are superior to the rest. However these biases, as concrete as well-proven as they are, are only part of the explanation. The book \"Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error\" by Kathryn Schulz is an exploration on why humans have the tendency to disregard errors and think they are always right. Shulz describes how people start with the assumption that they are right in everything they believe, and when they realise they have made a mistake, instead of challenging this assumption, they actually feel relief and think: \"I was right except for this particular error I was making, but now that I have realised it I can certainly say that I am 100% right in everything\".","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"How to win and make friends?","input":"","output":"As simple as this sounds, in reality, making friends and winning them is one of the toughest processes.

Rods connect the engines pistons to the journals of the crankshaft. The crankshaft is evenly balanced by  weights on the opposite side of each journal to ensure that at high revolutions per minute (RPM) the motor is stable. As the crankshaft rotates it pushes the rods up and down that are connected to pistons. At the front of the crankshaft is a gear, the gear is typically connected via a chain to the camshaft. If the crankshaft is the heart of the engine, a camshaft is the brain of the engine. The camshaft determines when to open and close valves that let in air and fuel into each cylinder and let out exhaust from the internal combustion. The camshaft is a shaft that runs the length of the engine and has lobes on it, small metal cylinders called lifters ride on these lobes and are connected to push rods, the push rods are connected to rockers which rock back and forth opening and closing valves in the cylinder heads. The valves are located in the cylinder heads that sit on top of the cylinders that the pistons are in. As the pistons rotate up, a valve (being driven by the camshaft) opens to bring fuel into the cylinder, when the valve closes a spark from a spark plug, ignites the fuel causing a mini explosion pushing the cylinder down, a second valve opens letting the exhaust from the mini explosion exit the engine. This in turn rotates the crankshaft, pushing another piston up where the process continues. An intake manifold is like the lungs of a motor, it breaths in air from the atmosphere and mixes it with just the right amount of fuel to create that mini explosion in the cylinder.  The timing of the air, fuel, spark delivery is critical if it is off just the smallest of margins the engine will not run at all.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Why do people like traveling for leisure?","input":"","output":"Moving around the world seems to be part of human beings nature.

The mouse allows for extremely fine grained movement of the viewing reticle to hone in on specific areas such as the target’s head.  Hitting the head often immediately results in death for the target or significant loss of health.

Why is this so?","input":"","output":"Braising is a common cooking technique where some primary ingredient (typically a cut of tough meat) cooks for a long time under low temperature and with lots of liquid. The main advantage of braising is that it causes the collagen in the meat fibers to break down into gelatin, which makes the meat fibers more separated and thus the meat more tender. In addition, the gelatin mixes with the remaining cooking liquids to create a scrumptious sauce. Thus, the overall process transforms meat from tough into tender, along with a tasty sauce that can be served alongside the meat. Braising is also convenient in that the cook does not have to attend frequently to the food during the cooking process. These two reasons, namely, rendering  tough cuts of meat (which also tend to be cheaper) more tender and requiring less effort from the cook, have made braising a common cooking technique among several cultures.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"How does the rational choice model help us understand the willingness of an individual to vote as well as whom she\/he will vote for?","input":"","output":"Downs and Riker come up with the calculus of voting, the formula, R=pB-C+D, where R is the probability that someone will vote, p is the probability of the vote “mattering”, B is the “utility” or benefit of vote, C is the cost of voting, and D is citizen duty.

Therefore, because there is a point of contact between water molecules (a strong polar bond in this case), water is wet.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"what is machine learning meaning?","input":"","output":"Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to imitate how humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Why do people travel do different places?","input":"","output":"One reason for people to travel is business.

First is overwatering. Houseplants are kept in containers that can retain water which can lead to root rot if not watered carefully. Some houseplants prefer the soil to dry out between waterings and many home gardeners end up watering before the soil has dried up sufficiently. Too much water in a container can lead to root rot which first can show symptoms in browning, dropping, and yellowing of leaves. Another reason for leaf discoloration is under watering as some plants prefer the soil to have a level of moisture at all times. Other reasons include too little sunlight which limits the plants ability to photosynthesize. Also, even too much sunlight can cause burned leaves.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"Are you ever too old for anything?","input":"","output":"The one thing i will always fiercely & unabashedly resent is the stance that someone is “too old for something” past a certain age.

In the old days, songs were indexed by song-writers. Prior to the digital age, the most popular media was physical cassettes, and it’s natural to group the cassettes by artists. Moreover, artists used to be the primary mechanism to discover new music. The cost of listening to new songs was usually high, since there were few ways to try new music, so fans tended to buy music from the same artists for quality (and taste) assurance.\n\nWith the evolution of music streaming and the decline of the recording industry, the granularity of “listening to music” has refined significantly. Listeners no longer need to buy whole cassettes, but can pick songs individually. Moreover, recommendation algorithms allow fans to discover music by popularity, genre or even mood.  As a result, music fans now sample from such a wide range of artists that it’s hard to name a single favorite. And due to the insane number of accessible songs, Even if you listen to a specific artist most frequently among your collection, you may still only like a small percentage of all the songs he\/she wrote, which leads to the shaky conviction that you actually have a “favorite musician”.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe the palette for music depends a lot on “environment”. It could be a physical environment (eg. beach or gym), an action (eg. working or cooking), or a mood (eg. chill or psyched). The like or dislike towards a certain piece of music changes drastically when these variables change. To some extent, I view music more as a tool than as an art form, in that I seek certain utility from music at different times. However, music judgment for me is also not 100% a rational or utilitarian process. It still very much comes from intuition, though that intuition is heavily biased by environmental factors.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"why does daylight savings still exist in the United States?","input":"","output":"In the United States, the economy used to be heavily based on agriculture.  Therefore, daylight savings was originally instituted to facilitate a farmer's workday so that much of the working hours could coincide with the hours where there was more daylight (daylight begins is later in the spring). Since then; however, the U.S. economy has become less agriculturally based and also with technological advancements that have drastically impacted American work patterns, the need to follow daylight windows has reduced dramatically. While daylight savings still allows many Americans to spend their working hours during the daylight, there is the popular opinion that daylight savings should no longer be observed in the United States, especially with the confusion that comes with changing hours during the spring and fall.  There are at least a couple states that do not change times for daylight savings which further adds to the confusion.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What birds can I find in San Francisco?","input":"","output":"You can find many birds in San Francisco, especially in parks like Golden Gate Park and the Lands End.

An evident example of this phenomenon is a beauty standard for women and men. Society seems to agree on what features, both physical and internal, can deem a person beautiful. The standard of beauty is also projected beyond humans, onto animal breeds, for example, in cat shows. \nA link between beauty and how closely it resembles perfection appears to exist. For example, a rose with many petals and no tears or scratches is generally seen as more beautiful than one with fewer, visibly ruined petals. \nHowever, the question of perfection also raises a problem as it is difficult and arguably impossible to define perfection. Beauty does not necessarily mean perfection. For example, large eyes are statistically considered to be more attractive however, in terms of their biological  purpose they possess no superiority to small eyes. Therefore, both beauty and perfection depend on the perspective or purpose with which you observe an object.\n\nFurthermore, the clear fluctuations through centuries and cultures on what is considered to be beautiful should also be taken into account. Fashion trends and art styles, for instance,  are constantly changing. Additionally, the diversity in opinions suggests there is nothing that is considered beautiful by everyone, so even if the majority deem a particular object or thing as beautiful, it’s beauty remains subjective because it remains based on an ever-changing preference rather than objective truth.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"What is the Tau Circle Constant?","input":"","output":"Tau is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius.  Some 21st century mathematicians and physicists believe Tau is a better choice than Pi for use in science and mathematics.\n\nLike Pi, Tau is an irrational and transcendental number.  In decimal form, the value of Tau is 6.283185…\n\nPart of the motivation for Tau is the observation that the number 2*Pi or 2π occurs with surprising frequency throughout science and mathematics.  This raises the question of whether Pi is really an important number or something equal to two times Pi is actually more important.  Perhaps the implication is that Pi is exactly one half of some very important number!\n\nFurther consideration of the question leads to several compelling observations:\n\n\t- Using C\/r as the key circle constant is better aligned with the way we define a circle: the set of all points a fixed distance (r) form a give point.\n\t- Radian angle measurements of fraction of a circle make much more sense when Tau is used as the base constant.  Using Pi, on quarter of a circle is Pi is Pi\/2, one half is Pi, and the angle of a a full circle is 2*Pi.  With Tau, the angle measures are intuitively aligned to the fraction of a circle: a quarter circle is Tau\/4, a half circle is Tau\/2 and the angle of a full circle is Tau.  \n\t- Similarly, the radian zeroes, max, and min of the sin and cosine functions align to fractions of Tau in an intuitive fashion that aids, rather than confuses, understanding.\n\t- Key formulas that traditionally use Pi actually show more clear mathematical meaning when expressed using Tau.  For example, the area of a circle itself, when expressed with Tau, shows the same pattern of quadratic forms in distance fallen, spring energy, and kinetic energy.\n\t- Similarly, the tau-based formula for circular area actually confirms to the original proof by Archimedes showing that area of a circle equals the area of a triangle with base C (circumference) and height r (radius):  A = 1\/2 b*h = 1\/2 C*r = 1\/2 (Tau*r)*r = 1\/2 Tau*r^2.\n\n\nTau has seen significant adoption since it was originally proposed.  \n\nThe relationship between Tau and Pi is very simple.  Tau = 2*Pi.  Perhaps just as informative is the fact that Tau > Pi.","category":"general_qa"},{"instruction":"I want to develop OKRs for my team at work.
