Aliasing occurs when a signal is sampled at a rate faster than its Nyquist frequency. This means that if we sample a signal at 100 Hz, it will be aliased into two frequencies: 50 Hz and 150 Hz. The reason for this is because the sampling process creates a new representation of the signal based on the number of samples taken.
