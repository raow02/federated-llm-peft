{"text": "What are the available treatments for Sensory processing disorder?", "answer": "Sensory Processing Disorder is a neurological condition that affects how our brain processes information about our environment. It causes us to experience things differently than most people do. This means we might feel overwhelmed or anxious when we're around certain sounds, smells, sights, textures, etc. We also might not respond well to some types of stimulation. For example, if you like to run outside but your SPD makes it hard for you to stay focused on running, you might find yourself getting frustrated and giving up easily. Or maybe you get really upset when someone touches you without asking first. These are just two examples of how SPD can affect our lives.", "category": "closed_qa"}
